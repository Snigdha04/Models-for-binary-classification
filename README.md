# Models-for-binary-classification

The goal of this assignment is to implement following linear models for binary classification
1. Fisher’s linear discriminant
2. Probabilistic Generative Model
3. Logistic Regression (Probabilistic Discriminative Model)

The dataset was taken from uci repository’s ’banknote authentication Data Set’. Each data instance has five values.

1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
4. entropy of image (continuous)
5. class (0 or 1).
